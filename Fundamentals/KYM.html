            works. But, it always pays if one also knows the internal working of
            the car-engine. Similarly, one can also learn programming in a
            certain language without knowing what a computer is and how it
            works.</i

          It is always desirable that a beginner should know the <i>abc</i> of
          computer's internal working and it is as well the objective of this
          section to familiarize beginners with the working of a computer.

          This section focuses on the principles on which a computer internally
          works and the principles of the modern digital computers.

          The computer does two things and two things only :-
          <br /><br />
          - <a class="intext"> Store the Data </a><br />
          - <a class="intext"> Manipulate the Data,</a> <br /><br />
          and it is very good at these two things. <br /><br />

          A device made up of the following three basic elements, namely :-
          <br /><br />
          <b>1. Input Device</b> : It reads into the
          <a class="intext">Central Processing Unit</a>. <br /><br />
          <b>2. Central Processing Unit</b> : The element of the computer
          consists of the following three units wired together. They are :
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>2.A Main Storage Unit </b> : The incoming data of the
          <a class="intext">input unit</a> and results of the
          <a class="intext">processing</a> are held in this unit. This unit
          consists of millions of continuous memory locations or cells, each of
          which is capable of holding one or more characters.
          <br />
          <b>2.B Arithmetic and Logic Unit (A.L.U.)</b> : It performs all the
          arithmetic and logical operations on the data and the instructions.
          <br />
          <b>2.C Control Unit</b> : It issues the signals to the other units for
          performing the required operations. Instructions and data held in the
          main storage are brought into this unit where they are interpreted and
          passed on to an appropriate unit. <br /><br />
          <b>3. Output Device</b> : After performing the required operations,
          each unit sends back the result to the
          <a class="intext">Main Storage</a>. These results are then sent to the
          requested output device which converts them into human readable form.

          ><br /><br />

          In 1642, <a class="intext" href="#">Blaise Pascal</a> constructed a
          <i>mechanical</i> calculator. This machine was composed of wheels or
          dials each marked from 0 to 9. This could add and subtract,
          multiplication and division was done through repeated addition and
          subtraction. Later, <a class="intext" href="#">Leibnitz</a> in 1671
          improved upon <i>Pascal's</i> machine which could only add and
          subtract. <i>Leibnitz's</i> machine could perform all the four basic
          functions of arithmetic. <br /><br />
          <a class="intext" href="#">Charles Babbage</a> constructed an
          <i>Analytical Engine</i>. The idea embodied in this device was that
          once the instructions and data are fed into the machine via punched
          cards, it would work upon it without the intervention of the operator.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <b><u>Electronic Calculator Versus Computer</u></b> : The two devices
          perform the same arithmetic operations of addition, subtractions,
          multiplication and division. The <i>electronic</i> calculator requires
          a man on its side to provide it the instructions by depressing its
          specific keys every now and then, whereas, the digital computer once
          supplied with the instructions to be executed and the data to be
          operated on, goes on automatically.
